# Titanic-Machine-Learning-From-Disaster
Data given is split into two groups:
* train.csv
* test.csv
# The training set 
Should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.
# The test set 
Should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
# Data Pre-processing:
* Converted Embarched into binary.
* Filled missing age with mean of the ages of people with same title of their name.
* Normalised Age and Fare since I'm using Euclidean metric.
